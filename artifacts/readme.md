I have just modified this script to suite my needs

This template creates an Active Directory forest for you. The configuration is flexible.

    Have a choice of one or two domains. The root domain is always created; the child domain is optional.
    Choose to have one or two DCs per domain.
    Choose names for the Domains, DCs, and network objects.
    Choose the VM type from a prepopulated list.
    Supported and tested are Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2, 2016 and 2019.
    Get one public IP endpoint to use with RDP, configured with a Network Security Group.
